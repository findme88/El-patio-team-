    "title": "Cherry pie",
    "descr": "Cherry pie is a pie baked with a cherry filling. Traditionally, cherry pie is made with tart rather than sweet cherries. Morello cherries are one of the most common kinds of cherry used, but other varieties such as the black cherry may also be used. Cherry pie is often eaten with whipped cream or ice cream. A common preparation tradition in the United States is to decorate the crust with ornate pastry patterns. A very different cherry-based dessert is Donauwelle in Germany and Austria."
